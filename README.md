```bash
fpm run -- configs/quick.json
```

Where the command line argument is the config file that sets the run settings. See the files in the `configs` directory for examples.

The program has the following dependencies which are automatically downloaded by FPM:
* [Fortran Astrodynamics Toolkit](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/Fortran-Astrodynamics-Toolkit)
* [ddeabm](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/ddeabm)
* [pyplot-fortran](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/pyplot-fortran)
* [json-fortran](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran)
